It was a beautiful sunny day and Leo took Kristina up to Piazzale Michelangelo, the famous square overlooking the city. Leo had been planning the perfect moment for months, and as he got down on one knee and asked the question, he couldn't contain his excitement. Kristina, overcome with emotion, couldn't help but shed a few tears of happiness as she happily said yes to spending the rest of her life with Leo. It was a moment the couple will never forget, and they are so excited to start their future together as husband and wife." %}</p>
