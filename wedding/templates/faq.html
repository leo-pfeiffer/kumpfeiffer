Fingask dates back to 1115 when it was recorded as a place of pilgrimage.  The castle itself dates to 1594.  Fingask Castle is known for its stunning gardens with whimsical topiaries.  Ornamental gardening is reputed to have begun here in the late 1600s with planting of vast quantities of box, holly and yew that became the first pieces of Fingask topiary.  With its 900+ years of history, beautiful gardens, and the breathtaking views of the Tay, Fingask Castle is a stunning backdrop for our special day."%}
